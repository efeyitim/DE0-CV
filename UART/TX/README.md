UART transmitter is implemented in VHDL. uart_tx.vhd file contains the transmitter module, top.vhd file contains the top module  which is for sending two bytes set by the switches on the board when a button is pressed, debounce.vhd is for debouncing the button, and the tb_uart_tx.vhd file is the test bench file of the uart_tx module. This project is tested on Terasic DE0-CV FPGA Board.
