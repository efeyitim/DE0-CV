This design is about learning how to debounce, and how to utilize user slide switches, leds. This design uses SW4 to SW0 slide switches. SW0 is debounced by software and it is used to start the counting. Counting can be seen by leds. If SW0 is up, the system will stay at IDLE, if SW0 is down system will count. SW1-SW2-SW3-SW4 fastens up the counting speed by the multiples of two respectively.
